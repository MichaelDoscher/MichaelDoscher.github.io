          <P>
            As I walk out my apartment doors I’m hit with a cool breeze and a delicious smell of the restaurants and the “Fresh Foods” deli across the street.
            It is a mixture of bacon grilling and the smell of German sausage sizzling from the restaurant Zum Schnieder.
            As I walk, a little further down the block I notice that the leaves on the trees have started to turn brown and fall slowly onto the sidewalk.
            I pass what my family calls “the red building” even though it hasn’t been red in years and outside my neighbors are having their normal chat on either side of the entryway.
          </P>
          <p>
            As I pass the “red building” I walk by the big old black lab that likes to lay down right  in front of the tall staircase that leads into his old building.
            On the staircase his old owner is sitting there wearing his faded tan cowboy hat and his brown hiking boots to go along with it.
            He is looking around as if he is patrolling the block to make sure there isn’t anything suspicious going on.
            Even though I have seen him almost everyday since I can remember, as I walk by he gives me a skeptical look as if one of these days I might just go crazy revealing a hidden identity that I had been keeping from him all these years.
          </p>
          <p>
            After passing him I am almost at the end of my block, and as I’m passing the broken down St. Brigids school on the corner I notice a commotion across the street.
            It is a group of what looks to be heavily intoxicated college students yelling at each other while stumbling down the street.
            As they sway back and forth bumping into each other while walking down the street I’m imagining how my old neighbor on the stairs is reacting to them.
            This isn’t a strange occurrence for the Lower East Side, even though it happened to be only 2 p.m.
            I knew they were most likely coming back from Veselka, McSorely’s or some other place on avenue B, where they were enjoying some bottomless brunch.
          </p>
          <p>
            I cross the street that has Rainbow colored wooden barriers blocking the traffic with big words written on it saying BLM.
            I enter Tompkins Square Park where I am greeted by the distant sound of drums playing in the background.
            There are people sitting on every bench by the entrance, while other people are walking their dogs on the dirt patch directly behind them close to the playgrounds jammed with children playing.
            As I walk closer to the center of the park I can hear the drums getting louder, and an electric guitar accompanying it as well as a singer who’s patiently singing some incoherent lyrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I walk into the center and can finally see the small stage where the music is coming from.
            There is a crowd of about 100 people who are hesitantly entranced by the hardcore rock that is being blasted at them.
            I find myself a bench on the outside of the circle where I can sit and wait for my friend to arrive as I watch more people get sucked into the performance as they walk by.
            Then I watch as a junkie with rags for clothes starts jogging into the crowd of the performance intently grabbing her can of Guinness so none of it spills. When she gets to her desired distance from the musicians I see her begin to bob her head and move her feet to the music.
            No one is backing up or giving dirty looks, they simply smile and begin to give a little head bob themselves. This is the Lower East Side where everyone is free to be their own unique, crazy, colorful, dancing selves, and everyone else respects that because they appreciate being a part of such a community.
